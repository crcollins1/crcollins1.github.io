This included compiling a document with each part, preferred manufacturer, unit cost, and cost per vehicle for the base vehicle as well as its various payload configurations. This data provided insight into the most expensive subsystems and vendors. Some of these results were expected and could be disregarded; however, some results prompted further investigation, such as my metal fabrication outsourcing project. This project required communication with manufacturing engineers and purchasing managers to identify the cost of parts and determine the material value of make vs buy parts. This analysis gave executives a clear glimpse into which subsystems were being impacted by supply chain issues.</a>

This experience gave me exposure to the testing and operation of complex AUV systems. On this particular mission, robotics engineers were using the Ziegler-Nichols method to tune the PID controller. This is important for the vehicle to perform bottom-lock navigation adequately. I learned a lot from watching the engineers perform these tests and document their findings. I assisted in the launch and recovery of the vehicle alongside field test engineers, listening to the instructions of the lead operator as we lifted the vehicle into and out of the water. Seeing the vehicle in action was important for me to fully understand all of the systems I was dealing with and how they each impacted day to day operations.</a>

I owned the design and construction of the Hardware and Dummy Kits. I worked with manufacturing engineers and field test engineers to determine what was needed in each kit, building on previous designs. I had complete ownership over the packaging and inventory needed for each kit. I had to consider the needs of the field operators as well as the environments in which they would be accessing these kits. Previously, the contents had been contained within a pelican case; however, the feedback I got from field operators was that opening the pelican cases on the deck of a boat in a rough sea state was less than ideal. I decided to use Milwaukee Packout Kits, which are easy to access and secure on the deck. I got very positive feedback from the operators using the kits I built. Upon completion of the project, I worked with the manufacturing manager to update the BOM and work instructions to include the parts I added as well as get those parts on order for the next kit. Ultimately Anduril wants to outsource these kits to an external vendor, so I worked with our sourcing engineer to research these opportunities and get a sample kit on order.</a>

                    <a style = "font-family: Courier New; font-size: 20px; text-decoration: none">One of the conclusions from the costing analysis I put together was that we were spending too much on sheet metal and machined parts. The vendors we were using (Protolabs and Xometry) were ideal for rapid prototyping and parts that were constantly changing; however, they were not sustainable for a high scale manufacturing environment. Anduril's goal is to get to higher levels of production, so it is important to research ways to bring these costs down. I developed a comprehensive list of relatively local machine shops and began quoting a "market basket" of parts that accurately represented all of the machined parts that we needed. I communicated with vendors on pricing and gauged their manufacturing capacities. The biggest challenge I ran into was proving to the machine shops that we were looking to provide sustained business in the next few years. I did this by providing insight into our forecasted production and communicating with the vendors on what sort of volumes they were looking for. Another component of this project was to evaluate the company's make vs buy decisions. I put together a list of the parts that we were fabricating in house and quoted those with various vendors. These parts were expensive and very low quality because of the minimal machining capabilities we had in house. I reviewed the list of vendors willing to machine these parts with our supply chain team and finalized the preferred vendor based on cost and quality. The new machine shops represent a 51.6% reduction in machined part cost, saving $6,887.42 per vehicle. According to forecasted production, this will result in $165,298.00 in annual cost savings.</a>

This requires a serious redesign of the systems that require 115V of AC power. I was tasked with researching ways to eliminate the need for a generator without sacrificing the devices it powers. I developed an action plan for implementing a new system of batteries, which included the introduction of Lithium-Iron Phosphate batteries. These provided a more space efficient and cost effective solution to the serious decrease in run times when moving away from a generator with the use of an alternator. I performed load calculations on the batteries to ensure they would be sufficient in powering the boat for extended periods of time even if the engines were not running. I then took the necessary number of batteries provided by the load calculations and input them directly into the master CAD file for the boat’s deck and hull design. This is so design engineers can gauge important characteristics of the boat, such as center of gravity and dry weight. My work led to Everglades’ first implementation of Lithium-based batteries, which is an important step towards higher energy efficiency.</a>

I was tasked with determining what the DCM board would look like for this boat due to the addition of two macerator pumps and a refrigeration system. Ultimately, I concluded that the new system required the addition of just one DCM to cover the increased amperage. I drew up a schematic for the board in AutoCAD and reviewed it with our electrical engineer. Upon approval, I worked to create a to-scale model of the board in Rhino, so the design department could include it in the hull models going forward. Some of the board's components were acquired from the companies that manufacture them; however, most of them were designed from scratch using the devices we had in house. The Rhino model (see above) was approved and is currently being used in the design of the boat as a whole.

Production capacity is supposed to double over the next year, so it will be important to keep up with the inventory required to meet demand. I was responsible for building on the Materials Requirement Planning process that was already in place in Netsuite. I performed safety stock calculations and updated important data such as lead times and preferred vendor. This contributed to more accurate production planning. While I was working on this project, I kept up with the open work orders and documented any inventory shortages that could affect production. I organized weekly meetings with the manufacturing and purchasing teams to identify any disconnect between what MRP was showing and what manufacturing was experiencing.</a>

Soiling causes up to a 20% loss in efficiency, which leads to over $10 billion in lost energy annually. My team was tasked with constructing a device to measure and record the efficiency loss of solar panels on solar farms due to soiling. The solution we created shines an internal LED light through a piece of soiled glass and converts the corresponding photoresistor value to a percent efficiency. This data is then transmitted via bluetooth to the nearby user. My primary resonsibility was creating a system that would apply light to an exposed microscope slide every 12 hours. I used a four bar linkage powered by a servo motor controlling 3 gears to move the light over the slide. The servo motor was programmed using Arduino to rotate a certain number of degrees every 12 hours. I was also responsible for developing a way to easily access the electronics on the inside of the device. This was accomplished by building a door in the back, which was hinged and secured at the top by a strong magnet, providing a water tight seal. My team and I worked to overcome many hurdles throughout the design process. Our hard work payed off, as our device was taken back to the lab from which the problem statement came from for further development!</a>

Most of the men and women that are working the production line have been building boats for 20+ years. A lot of the problems that they encounter with the wiring, tend to be solved amongst themselves. This presents a problem because when those men and women leave the company, they take all of that vital knowledge with them. My job was to go to the production line to document the problems that they experience on a daily basis and communicate them to the engineering and wire harnessing teams. This was a particular issue on the Everglades 235CC, 243CC, 253CC, 273CC, 335CC, and 340DC, as all of the boats have been in production since the early 2000’s. This required a serious investigation into the problems within the harness designs. I worked with manufacturing engineers and production line operators to diagnose exactly what issues were being encountered, and how they were being solved. Any issues that required harness revisions, I altered in AutoCAD and Rhino and communicated to the engineering team. The new harness drawings have been approved, and will be implemented on the next models that go to the line.</a>

I worked with companies like Garmin International, TaylorMade, Mercury Marine, and Yamaha Motor Company to understand where the luxury fishing boat market was heading, and what new technologies could and should be implemented on future models. I had to develop a thorough understanding of the systems on our current models in order to envision how new technology could be implemented. This work included meeting with design engineers, electrical engineers, and upper level managers to investigate the impact these innovations would have on the product line and the customer. For example, one specific project that I worked on alongside Garmin engineers was the implementation of a voice control system for sound, lighting, and simple navigation. Ultimately, we deemed it possible, but not desired due to the need for an external headset. Other technologies, such as a surround view camera system for docking aid, have been approved and sent to the sales and marketing team for further discussion.</a>
