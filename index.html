This requires a serious redesign of the systems that require 115V of AC power. I was tasked with researching ways to eliminate the need for a generator without sacrificing the devices it powers. I developed an action plan for implementing a new system of batteries, which included the introduction of Lithium-Iron Phosphate batteries. These provided a more space efficient and cost effective solution to the serious decrease in run times when moving away from a generator with the use of an alternator. I performed load calculations on the batteries to ensure they would be sufficient in powering the boat for extended periods of time even if the engines were not running. I then took the necessary number of batteries provided by the load calculations and input them directly into the master CAD file for the boat’s deck and hull design. This is so design engineers can gauge important characteristics of the boat, such as center of gravity and dry weight. My work led to Everglades’ first implementation of Lithium-based batteries, which is an important step towards higher energy efficiency.</a>

I was tasked with determining what the DCM board would look like for this boat due to the addition of two macerator pumps and a refrigeration system. Ultimately, I concluded that the new system required the addition of just one DCM to cover the increased amperage. I drew up a schematic for the board in AutoCAD and reviewed it with our electrical engineer. Upon approval, I worked to create a to-scale model of the board in Rhino, so the design department could include it in the hull models going forward. Some of the board's components were acquired from the companies that manufacture them; however, most of them were designed from scratch using the devices we had in house. The Rhino model (see above) was approved and is currently being used in the design of the boat as a whole.

Soiling causes up to a 20% loss in efficiency, which leads to over $10 billion in lost energy annually. My team was tasked with constructing a device to measure and record the efficiency loss of solar panels on solar farms due to soiling. The solution we created shines an internal LED light through a piece of soiled glass and converts the corresponding photoresistor value to a percent efficiency. This data is then transmitted via bluetooth to the nearby user. My primary resonsibility was creating a system that would apply light to an exposed microscope slide every 12 hours. I used a four bar linkage powered by a servo motor controlling 3 gears to move the light over the slide. The servo motor was programmed using Arduino to rotate a certain number of degrees every 12 hours. I was also responsible for developing a way to easily access the electronics on the inside of the device. This was accomplished by building a door in the back, which was hinged and secured at the top by a strong magnet, providing a water tight seal. My team and I worked to overcome many hurdles throughout the design process. Our hard work payed off, as our device was taken back to the lab from which the problem statement came from for further development!</a>

Most of the men and women that are working the production line have been building boats for 20+ years. A lot of the problems that they encounter with the wiring, tend to be solved amongst themselves. This presents a problem because when those men and women leave the company, they take all of that vital knowledge with them. My job was to go to the production line to document the problems that they experience on a daily basis and communicate them to the engineering and wire harnessing teams. This was a particular issue on the Everglades 235CC, 243CC, 253CC, 273CC, 335CC, and 340DC, as all of the boats have been in production since the early 2000’s. This required a serious investigation into the problems within the harness designs. I worked with manufacturing engineers and production line operators to diagnose exactly what issues were being encountered, and how they were being solved. Any issues that required harness revisions, I altered in AutoCAD and Rhino and communicated to the engineering team. The new harness drawings have been approved, and will be implemented on the next models that go to the line.</a>

I worked with companies like Garmin International, TaylorMade, Mercury Marine, and Yamaha Motor Company to understand where the luxury fishing boat market was heading, and what new technologies could and should be implemented on future models. I had to develop a thorough understanding of the systems on our current models in order to envision how new technology could be implemented. This work included meeting with design engineers, electrical engineers, and upper level managers to investigate the impact these innovations would have on the product line and the customer. For example, one specific project that I worked on alongside Garmin engineers was the implementation of a voice control system for sound, lighting, and simple navigation. Ultimately, we deemed it possible, but not desired due to the need for an external headset. Other technologies, such as a surround view camera system for docking aid, have been approved and sent to the sales and marketing team for further discussion.</a>

I took 2 6x8 pieces of plywood and transformed them into the letters you see above. I carefully cut out the letters, applied paint, and attached LED strips to the outer edges of the plywood. I had to solder multiple LED strips together in order to effectively cover the outer edges. The final product turned out well, and has needed minimal troubleshooting.</a>
