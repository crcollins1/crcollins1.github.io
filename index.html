                    <a style = "font-family: Courier New; font-size: 20px; text-decoration: none">The newest Everglades Boat model is the beginning of a shift away from heavy, loud, and burdensome generators, leaving behind just batteries. This requires a serious rethinking of the systems on board that currently require 115V of AC power such as refrigeration and seakeeper technology. I researched ways to use new batteries to power the systems in question without sacrificing much run time with the use of an alternator. I developed a plan of action for implementing a new system of batteries, which included the introduction of Lithium-Iron Phosphate. These provide a more space-efficient and cost effective solution to the shift away from a generator. I then performed load calculations on the new battery system to ensure it would be sufficient in powering the boat for extended periods of time, even if the engines were not running.</a>

                    <a style = "font-family: Courier New; font-size: 20px; text-decoration: none">In the marine industry, there is a phenonemon called "tribal knowledge." Most of the men and women that work the production line have been building the same boats for 20+ years. Every time a problem occurs within the wire harnessing, they find ways to overcome the obstacle. This presents a problem later on because when those men and women leave the company, they take all of their knowledge about the production of that boat with them. My job was to go to the production line to document the problems that they experience on a daily basis and communicate them to the wire room and engineering department so that the proper changes could be made. This was a particular issue on the Everglades 235CC, 243CC, 253CC, 273CC, and 340DC as all of these models have been on the production line since the early 2000's. The new harness drawings that I drew up based on feedback from line workers and electrical engineers have been approved and will be implemented on the next boats that go into production.</a>

Soiling causes up to a 20% loss in efficiency, which leads to over $10 billion in lost energy annually. My team was tasked with constructing a device to measure and record the efficiency loss of solar panels on solar farms due to soiling. The solution we created shines an internal LED light through a piece of soiled glass and converts the corresponding photoresistor value to a percent efficiency. This data is then transmitted via bluetooth to the nearby user. My primary resonsibility was creating a system that would apply light to an exposed microscope slide every 12 hours. I used a four bar linkage powered by a servo motor controlling 3 gears to move the light over the slide. The servo motor was programmed using Arduino to rotate a certain number of degrees every 12 hours. I was also responsible for developing a way to easily access the electronics on the inside of the device. This was accomplished by building a door in the back, which was hinged and secured at the top by a strong magnet, providing a water tight seal. My team and I worked to overcome many hurdles throughout the design process. Our hard work payed off, as our device was taken back to the lab from which the problem statement came from for further development!</a>

This includes voice control features, phone connectivity, improved engine models, display systems, lighting fixtures, etc. I worked with companies like Garmin International, Taylormade, Mercury Marine, and Yamaha Motor Company to understand where the luxury fishing boat market was heading, and what new technologies could and should be implemented on the new model.
